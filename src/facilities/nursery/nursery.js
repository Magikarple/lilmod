			"Roman Revivalist": `is run with the Roman dream in mind, with wide open windows exposing the babies to the elements. The sleek marble halls bring a sense of serenity and duty as wet nurses wander the halls.`,
			"Neo-Imperialist": `is modeled as an ultra high-tech nursing area, with omnipresent advanced machinery monitoring every heartbeat of the babies within, the soft glow of machines pulsating against the banners of your family crest lining the walls.`,
			"Aztec Revivalist": `is lined head to toe in illustrious Aztec gold. Tiny but notable subscripts lay in plaques to honor the mothers who died giving birth, the children of said mothers, alive or dead, are tirelessly watched over to tend to their every need.`,
			"Egyptian Revivalist": `is decorated by sleek, sandstone tablets, golden statues, and even grander Egyptian wall sculptures, many of them depicting the conception, birth, and raising of a child. Each babe is reverently wrapped in linen covers as they drift to sleep to the stories of mighty pharaohs and prosperous palaces.`,
			"Edo Revivalist": `is minimalist in nature, but the errant paintings of cherry blossoms and vibrant Japanese maples give a certain peaceful air as the caretakers do their duties.`,
			"Arabian Revivalist": `is decorated wall to wall with splendorous carvings and religious Hamsas meant to protect the fostering children.`,
			"Chinese Revivalist": `is ripe with Chinese spirit. Depictions of colorful dragons and oriental designs grace the halls, rooms, and cribs of the babies who reside inside.`,
			"Antebellum Revivalist": `is warm and inviting. Carved wooden panels line the lower half of the walls while gentle pastel colored wall paper decorates the upper half; a soft pink for where the girls stay, and a baby blue for the boys. Big windows of frosted glass shine onto a rich walnut floor. Hand-crafted cribs line the walls.`,
			"Chattel Religionist": `is decorated with childish religious cartoons and artistic tapestries of slaves bowing in submission, their themes always subsiding varying degrees of sexual worship. The caretakers that wander the halls obediently wear their habits, and never waste a moment to tenderly lull the children to sleep with stories of their prophet.`,
			"Degradationist": `is bare and sullen. The cries of the neglected children destined for slavery trying to find comfort in their burlap coverings echo the halls, while those that await freedom are raised among luxury and are taught to look down on their less fortunate peers.`,
			"Repopulationist": `is designed to be very open and public; a showing testament to your arcology's repopulation efforts. For those old enough to support them, they are strapped with big, but body warming, empathy bellies as to remind them of their destiny.`,
			"Eugenics": `is of utmost quality without a single pleasantry missing â€” if the parents are of the elite blood of course. While there are rare stragglers of unworthy genes, the child populace overall is pampered with warm rooms and plentiful small toys.`,
			"Asset Expansionist": `is not so much decorated as it is intelligently staffed. Every passerby, slave or not, burns the image of their jiggling asses and huge, wobbling tits into the minds of the children.`,
			"Transformation Fetishist": `is kept simple and clean. From their toys down to the nursemaids, the babies are exposed to the wonders of body transformation whenever possible.`,
			"Gender Radicalist": `is decorated by cheery cartoon depictions of slaves of many shapes, sizes, and genitals, all of them undeniably feminine. The elated smiles and yips of the nurses getting reamed constantly instill the appreciation of nice, pliable buttholes.`,
			"Gender Fundamentalist": `is simply designed and painted with soft feminine colors. The staff heavily encourage the children to play dress up and house, subtly sculpting their minds to proper gender norms and properly put them in line if they try to do otherwise.`,
			"Physical Idealist": `is furnished with kiddy health books and posters; their caretakers making painstakingly sure that the importance is drilled into their heads at a young age. Their food is often littered with vitamins and supplements to keep the children growing strong.`,
			"Supremacist": `is designed and structured to give those of ${V.arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace} ethnicity the limelight of the nursery, while the others stay sectioned off and neglected to the world.`,
			"Subjugationist": `is made to foster and raise the young children of ${V.arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace} ethnicity. They are reminded of their place with every failure and are encouraged to submissively follow their stereotypes at a ripe young age.`,
			"Paternalist": `is well-stocked and by Paternalistic customs, constantly swaddle the children with love and attention. With the warm colors and sound of child laughter, to the untrained eye, the children actually seem free.`,
			"Pastoralist": `is decorated to make the children grow up thinking that a life focused on breast milk, cum, and other human secretions are part of the norm. The milky tits swaying above their cow-patterned cribs certainly help with that.`,
			"Maturity Preferentialist": `decorations remind the kids to respect those curvy and mature. The older nurserymaids are always flattered whenever the children try to act like adults and take care of the younger toddlers for them.`,
			"Youth Preferentialist": `is making young children the center of attention, their rooms supplied with plenty of toys, blankets, and surrogate mothers at their beck and call.`,
			"Body Purist": `is decorated to be very clean cut and sterilized with perfect corners and curves; symbolic of the human figure. Nursery maids are encouraged to show off their natural assets to show the children what the appropriate body should be.`,
			"Slimness Enthusiast": `constantly encourages the kids to try and keep their slim and cute physiques. They are given perfectly metered meals to make this possible.`,	// TODO: tie this in to food system
			"Hedonistic": `would make any toddler drool in amazement. Meals and naps every other hour, cribs stalked with toys and blankets, and plush slaves carry them to and fro without preamble. A delicious layer of baby fat is the ideal figure of a baby, and they couldn't be happier.`,
			"Intellectual Dependency": `is decorated in some way relating to Intellectual Dependency.`,	// TODO:
			"Slave Professionalism": `is decorated in some way relating to Slave Professionalism.`,	// TODO:
			"Petite Admiration": `has large photos and paintings on the walls depicting small, petite children enjoying ${this.facility.name}'s amenities and having fun together.`,
