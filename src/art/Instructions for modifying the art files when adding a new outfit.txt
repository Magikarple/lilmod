Are you adding a new outfit to the game, but don't have SVG art for it? If so, you MUST modify the following functions in VectorArtJS.js.

1. ArtVectorBalls()
2. ArtVectorBelly()
3. ArtVectorBoob()
4. ArtVectorBoobAddons() (in two different places)
5. ArtVectorChastityBelt()
6. ArtVectorFeet()
7. ArtVectorPussyPiercings()
8. ArtVectorTorsoOutfit()

Still don't know where to add your edits? Just search the file for the string "no clothing". Anywhere you see this string you must add your new clothing.
