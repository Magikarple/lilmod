Given its one-occupant design, it comes well supported with its global-uplink communications array, onboard super computer, shock and blast resistant interior foam padding, adjustable body harness, extended life support & CBRN protection suites, advanced waste removal systems, and its in-built pregnancy-support systems. Should she ever decide to take to the battlefield whilst ${hyperPreg1} pregnant herself, there is no vehicle in the world she would prefer over this one. Despite not yet being ${hyperPreg0}pregnant, she is impressed by how roomy, comfortable, and capable her new Command Vehicle is, despite its large profile. You see her using it quite a bit too, despite her body still being much smaller than the unit was designed for.`;

Your Firebase's soldiers bid for the privilege of having their sperm used for the fertilization of new captives, and childbirth is a requisite for pussy-slaves to qualify for basic training.`;
				commonArea = `There are many double-decker baby carriages found both lined up on the outskirts of the common area and on the sides of several tables, and a good amount of them have small babies in them, awaiting their father or mother's attention. Someday soon, all of the carriages will be full.`;
				barracks = `Off the side of the barracks lies an empty backroom that has since been repurposed into a proper nursery staffed by caring slaves. Conventional incubators for the newborns of the grunts have been installed, and there is even an advanced incubator installed in the corner to age officers' slave children very rapidly.`;
				armoury = `The Armoury has a small and transparent soundproofed chamber off its side where an old soldier nearing retirement teaches basic firearm safety and marksmanship to a groups of very young children born and being raised in the Firebase. Meanwhile, the troopers that come here to retrieve their weapons often name their armament after their own families. Word has it that the current Firebase tradition in effect is to name your service rifle after your firstborn, your sidearm after your second born, and your grenades after your bastards.`;
				commandCenter = `There is a large soundproofed playpen, built with frosted glass, in the middle of the Command Center. It is filled with all sorts of toys and luxuries for the children kept inside, alongside the trusted and suitably modest hired nannies. Here, the surrounding command and control staff on-shift visit and play with their numerous children within, whenever they are not directing field operations.`;

These incubators are cutting edge by global standards, pioneering the complex science of growing existing babies to become bigger, stronger, smarter, more beautiful, and of course, more fertile. All of this special machinery has a purpose, of course; the next generation of skilled mechanics and crewmen is fast approaching.`;
				vehicle = `Every main battle tank you have features a much broader and taller turret than before, and even more strangely, each turret is egg-shaped. This peculiar shape accommodates an extreme functionality; the multi-pregnancy cockpit - in which tankers not only control their vehicles, but also conceive, deliver, and incubate their own babies. The latest in compact conventional incubators line the interior walls of the turret, and through these, your tanker crews are known to make and sustain all of their newest children throughout their careers in your armor units. It is well known that your tank crews rarely spend much time away from their vehicles for this very reason, and their offspring often choose to become tankers themselves.`;

At any given time, these open spaces are in heavy use by the unattended children of the airmen and airwomen who are busy at work here. The longest wall of the hangar is also host to a massive and beautiful mural altogether depicting all of the newborn children fathered or mothered by the Firebase's pilots and airmen thus far. While artful, this mural also holds the promise that through this multitude of progeny, the hangar will always have a rich supply of dedicated pilots and service personnel for the foreseeable future.`;
				aircraft = `Within the numerous transport aircraft of the hangar, a unique change can be found; since greater human quantity is a focus and priority of the Firebase, more seating has been carefully welded into the interiors of every passenger section, leading to tighter fits, but bigger troop payloads once the transport aircraft touch down. While it currently is uncomfortable for the troops, once the great many claimed and registered children of the current generation of Firebase troops grow up and seek to follow in their parent's footsteps, these abundant seating arrangements will be downright necessary to transport sufficient amounts of these hordes of hopefuls to and from future battles without leaving too many behind.`;
				luxuries = `Near the barracks, the residents of the Firebase are grateful to have the aid of the All-In-One Parenthood Infirmary. This impressively large and well-equipped facility is staffed with professionals from all over the arcology, and these certified midwives and midmen carry out all the services needed to help this place function as a refuge for personnel during all stages of parenthood; it contains rooms for a fertility clinic, a delivery clinic, a post-natal workshop, and even a high-capacity daycare center.`;
				perimeter = `The outside entrance of the Firebase features a modest outdoor playground, complete with jungle gyms, see saws, sandboxes, a few kiddie pools and many other children's amusements. The playground is surrounded by tall barbed wire fences however, and in the center is an imposing guard tower that serves as a useful vantage point for the squad of snipers and spotter assigned to there to keep watch.`;
				roleplaying = `By now, most of the men of the Firebase are fathers, and the vast majority of the slaves present are visibly pregnant. An envied few are enjoying their ${hyperPreg1}pregnancies too, as those slaves are given reduced duties and more rest and food out of necessity. Worth noting is the surprisingly high number of pregnant soldiers and staff members absent from their units; a nice portion of them are enjoying their maternity leave benefits as they wait out their pregnancies or post-natal recoveries in either the Firebase's facilities or the perceived comfort and privacy of your arcology above. Progeny of varying ages can be seen just about anywhere in the Firebase; either in rows of cozy bedding or baby carriages (for the abundance of claimed and properly registered children), or in the stacks of baby cages that once again await transport to the slave orphanages (for the multitude of newborn bastards).`;
				colonel = `Repopulation: The Colonel has spent considerable savings creating and incubating a slave that looks exactly like a younger version of her (but with that steel collar she's wearing, she'll never fool anyone). The Slave has since been repeatedly fertilized with The Colonel's DNA, since The Colonel has no desire to get pregnant herself. The Slave is on many fertility pills, and is currently kept in a special secluded part of the Firebase to study child-rearing skills and wait out her ${hyperPreg0}pregnancy, after which she will train and heal up to recover. Of course, next year, The Slave will be fertilized again, to add another batch to the pile...`;

It also has absurd durability and reliability, able to survive and continue driving even after sustaining direct RPG fire. It boasts a rare lightweight composite material chassis, onboard voice-activated AI personal assistant, advanced ballistics-retardant windows, Kevlar-lined run-flat tires, mine-resistant undercarriage, integrated long-term life support and CBRN protection systems, and even a passenger's seat to bring a friend along. She is floored by how exotic and capable her magnificent new car is. You see her using it quite a bit too, for both joyrides and casual errands around the Free City.`;
				foods = `For the male soldiers who eat in-house, every meal comes with a free condom. Instead of a condom, female soldiers are instead given a tiny packet of contraceptive pills that are disguised as sweet tasting hard candies.`;

				slaves = `Many of the slaves serving here are sterilized, and those that are not carry condoms on their person at all times.`;
				cages = `Every new slave is rigorously inspected by 'personnel' experts send by your arcology's Elite. Those few that meet the exacting standards are housed in the superior individual cages in the rear of the slave processing area. Their training will be distinctive.`;
				commonArea = `The common area now includes a small den serving as an office for soldiers interested in taking the arcology's Elite citizenship exams. As you pass by, you actually see one of the newer troopers leaving the den. There is a hopeful look on their face.`;
				barracks = `The simple staff room next to the storage room of the barracks has been expanded and upgraded to serve as a luxurious 'Officers Club'. This warrior lounge admits only those of adequate rank and status, and comes complete with a private bar, private theaters, a conference room, an indoor garden, and premium, exclusive sex slaves.`;
				armoury = `A finely groomed coterie of Elite armorers descended from higher society has been assigned to the Firebase on a permanent rotation basis. They work diligently on repainting, retooling, refurbishing, or recalibrating each and every piece of kit, as needed, in between missions while using only the finest of modern instruments and materials. As such, your troops represent your arcology with some of the best kept battle gear in the world.`;
				commandCenter = `There is a discreet team of 'personnel experts' to be found in each station of the command center. These scorekeepers are charged with constantly tallying the talents, successes and failures, and genetic traits of the commanders and officers on duty. Those with the best scores at the end of each half-year are recommended for immediate promotion to Elite status by reports that the teams compile. For their own part, they are very steadfast and brutally honest in their work, and seemingly immune to intimidation and bribery.`;
				drugLab = `The drug laboratory has been supplemented with a luxurious rehabilitation clinic, where soldiers and staff who tend to indulge a bit too much and need to regain control of themselves are free to get the help they need to take back their dignity.`;
				personalItems = `In the lockers and duffel bags of the majority of Firebase soldiers, you can find a variety of self-help books and self-improvement literature. You can also find several bundles of fine dress suits and/or dresses, along with some custom tailored casual clothing. There is usually also an assortment of handkerchiefs and other accessories, which vary in quality depending on the inventory's owner.`;

These stratagems are cutting edge by global standards, pioneering the complex science of attacking a variety of opposing forces so as to minimize overall casualties and maximize the demoralization, pacification, and capture of enemy personnel.`;
				vehicle = `Every vehicle crew leader in the Firebase is an Elite, and is thus privy to the contents of these strategy meetings. As such, every vehicle crew has a great deal of power in determining their own armor kits and loadouts to best fit the tactics used for their next mission. Every crewman is handpicked, and every single vehicle unit is unique, with the only similarity being the common ground vehicle chassis types between them. Your tanker crews have been known to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with the help of their unique and unpredictable individuality and unconventional unit compositions throughout their careers in your armor units. Inspired of these glorious service records, their offspring often choose to become vehicle crewmen themselves.`;
				hangar = `The hangar is a cavernous place, and when takeoffs and landings are not in progress there are many open spaces for gangs of ambitious air force understudies to gather around veterans and teachers and learn more about their craft, as well as lots of places to simply kick back with a good book and await the next summons for a CASEVAC, air assault, or assault support flight mission. At any given time, these open spaces are in heavy use by the airmen and airwomen who are not busy at work here. The longest wall of the hangar is also host to a massive and beautiful mural altogether depicting all of the renowned aces and flight instructors the Firebase has known throughout its history thus far. While artful, this mural also holds the promise that through this multitude of Elite personnel, the hangar should always have a rich pool of skillful pilots and maintenance personnel for the good of the service.`;
				aircraft = `Within the numerous transport aircraft of the hangar, a unique change can be found; since greater human quality is a focus and priority of the Firebase, the seating for passengers has been completely replaced by rows of specialized transport pods; every passenger now has a life-support enabled, environmentally-sealed, shock-absorbent, blast-resistant, and fireproof individual pod to climb into and remain inside of until their aircraft arrives at their intended destination. These pods are welded into the interiors of every passenger section, leading to an extreme degree of passenger survivability, even when crashed or shot down by enemy fire, but at the cost of smaller troop payloads once the transport aircraft touch down. While it currently is uncomfortable for the troops, once the proud few, specially bred and registered children of the current generation of Firebase troops grow up and seek to follow in their parent's footsteps, these advanced 'seating' arrangements will be downright necessary to protect the lives of the Firebase's greatest and scarcest asset; its Elite fighting personnel.`;
				luxuries = `Near the barracks, the residents of the Firebase are grateful to have the aid of the Aristocracy Academy. This impressively large and well-equipped facility is staffed with Elites from all over the arcology, and these impeccable men and women carry out all the services needed to help this place function as a part-time 'Finishing School' for all members of the Firebase; the curriculum specializes in training unkempt soldiers and staff to become proper ladies and gentlemen; how to dress, speak, behave, dance, and handle a wide variety of decidedly civilian scenarios in the classiest manner possible.`;
				perimeter = `The outside entrance of the Firebase features a distinguished officer's academy, complete with a state-of-the-art lecture hall, multipurpose war rooms, combat drill chambers, private lodging cabins, a few sand pits, and many other training necessities. The faculty consists of decorated veteran officers, and throughout the structure there are stationed honor guard sentries assigned to ensure the safety of the Elite officer cadets busily training all around them.`;
				roleplaying = `The Firebase is clean and posh; whatever the festivity or facility, the staff and soldiery carry themselves with an air of superior esteem and dignity and are given only the finest of materials and tools to use when performing their duties. However, a strong social strata is clear those proud few who passed the Elite testing make up the overwhelming majority of the higher command staff and officer ranks, whilst those who have not passed the test are mostly their subordinates. Elites of the Firebase sit first, eat first, and get first pickings of battle loot, captives, promotions, and of course, sanctioned breeding partners. Without fail, everyone in the Firebase has taken the Elite test, and without fail, everyone Who flunked it has been issued their complimentary vasectomy or hysterectomy.`;
				colonel = `Eugenics: The Colonel has her 'Right To Breed' Certificate hung up on her pavilion for all to see. She easily passed all of your society's tests, and is now proudly among your Societal Elite. Next to her certificate you also see a framed picture: this is a photograph she took on her tablet not long ago, showing an Elite staring into the camera and holding his bloody nose after he pressed her just a bit too much about having children with him. On her pavilion, you also see a small cardboard box containing some top quality condoms and spermicides. It seems she's enjoying the privilege of having her pick of any attractive youngster she desires on the upper levels.`;

To ease her further into the Radicalist mindset, you've gone all out: You've carved out an unused sidewall of the Firebase to build her a private champagne room, complete with several stripper stages with exotic lighting options, highly trained stripper slaves, an AI DJ, a marble bar counter with barstools, a cozy long sofa with cooler armrests, and plenty of chairs for lap dances. When she first entered this little house room, she also found the extravagant lingerie wardrobe you've had made to her exact measurements, for her off days. And to ensure that her after-hours retreat is extra enjoyable, you have not forgotten to provide her with a specific premium surgery voucher, to grant her a free organ cloning & grafting futanarization procedure at any clinic in the arcology, at any time of her choosing.`;
				foods = `Most foods within the Firebase are now laced with minor and tasteless testosterone additives to gradually promote more masculinity in the troops, while the slave food is specially made with estrogen additives to foster femininity. With each meal, troops are also given a tiny plastic vial of lube, for later use.`;
				media = `Much of the porn and movies seen in the Firebase now feature obvious trannies along with some very convincing traps and sissies. They are all depicted as submitting to powerful characters of both genders, and even the occasional futanari, both sexually and non-sexually.`;
				slaves = `Some of the slaves you see now sound, appear, and act very effeminate, despite their gender. Your gay male soldiers use these slaves quite a bit, and your female soldiers sometimes even chat with them on occasion.`;
				cages = `Thanks to the guards, the many dickgirl slaves the Firebase brings in are discreetly offered considerable rewards to sodomize a fellow dickgirl. During daily showers, the slaves are lined up in groups near the shower wall, and given a bar of soap that they are amusedly instructed not to drop.`;
				commonArea = `The pleasure dens have been neatly rearranged into a small grid of sorts, with straight walkways lying neatly between them, and they now feature gaudy red neon lighting alongside clear glass window booths for the androgynous slave whores inside to advertise their mouths, butts, and if available, cocks. It all comes together to form a seedy 'Red Light' district of the Firebase, one amiably reminiscent of its counterparts in some Old World cities.`;
				barracks = `The storage room of the barracks has become something of a soundproofed strip club. With crates piled high to the sides to make room, a dozen stripper poles, huge speakers, sofas, a DJ booth, and private 'dance' booths come together to dominate the mood. Soldiers and dancers go to and fro, and the room smells strongly of cigarette smoke, alcohol, and ass.`;
				armoury = `Each rack, shelf, and locker in the armoury has an obnoxious neon sign above it indicating its purpose and contents. The metallic walls and flooring are covered in frequently updating, advanced motion picture wallpapers depicting animated illustrations of Firebase troops corralling naked civilians and surrendering soldiers at gunpoint. In these animations, the few captives that are not being prodded into transports are being held down and taken anally. The buttstocks of most rifles and machine guns in the armoury are hallowed out to make room for a slim vial of lube to be slotted in too. Just in case.`;
				commandCenter = `There is a discreet row of small cubicles near the exit of the command center. Each cubicle has an anonymous but skilled sex slave inside and a square hole and condom dispenser at waist level so that deserving commanders have a place to relieve their loins and stress after a tense mission. They cannot discern any details about the slave on the other side; the gender and looks of their attendant are as unknown to them as they are irrelevant.`;
				drugLab = `There is a funky nightclub room branching out of the drug laboratory, and it is a great place to experience new highs. There is a DJ table with jumbo speakers, and a technicolor disco ball overlooking a dancefloor surrounded by colorful sofas; this is a place where the many partygoers in the Firebase are invited to collectively let loose as they try out the newest recreational substances the drug lab has invented.`;
				personalItems = `Firebase personnel can often be seen wearing obnoxious makeup, taking futanari-optimized herbal products & supplements, and renting the services of the dolled-up futanari-slaves available.`;
				droneBay = `Your flying hunter-killer drones have been modified to entirely resemble the male genitalia, much like giant flying realistic dildoes; the main hull and body of the drone looks like a giant ballsack, whilst the main armament has been redecorated to look like a giant cock. Of course, the tracers these dick-drones fire are also bright white.`;
				garage = `On the longest wall of the garage is a cartoonish motion picture illustration depicting quite a lively, lurid scene; every fighting vehicle used in the Firebase is depicted on shown with a phallic turret, and they are all shown to be blasting away at enemy vehicles and fortifications with very fast streams of burning hot semen that melt them on contact.`;
				vehicle = `Of course, due to their immense power, every combat vehicle in the garage is regarded as being 'male', and to celebrate this, every gun barrel and missile launcher that your ground vehicles use have been specially customized to now resemble phalluses. Your dick-shaped cannons now strike as much fear into the enemy as the vehicles they are attached too.`;
				hangar = `With its high-ceiling and many light fixtures, the hangar is distinctive in its appearance and function; the conventional overhead lighting has been replaced with provocative neon lighting that makes the work stations below perpetually look like naughty nighttime city streets. And in a way, they are. Chain-smoking tranny hookers streetwalk the hangar's many dark corners, while the bathroom's many stalls are infested with scribbled vulgar writings and well-used gloryholes. A shady looking deli shop and adjacent ATM machine lie near the entrance too, their flickering lights almost daring the staff and pilots of the hangar to enter.`;
				aircraft = `The aircraft themselves have taken on a particular mood too. The individual aircraft are refereed to as 'male' so as to acknowledge their inherent power and superiority on the battlefield. Bright neon lights line interiors of the cockpits and/or passenger sections of each craft. The nose-mounted and door gunner armaments of the various craft have been modified to resemble dicks too, even going to far as to have the ammunition drums attached to their bases resemble ballsacks. Of course, the tracers these phallic weapons fire are colored bright white too, much like semen. Therefore, the enemy units that find themselves facing their wrath are quite literally 'Fucked'.`;
				luxuries = `Adjacent to the command center is the notorious 'sex stage'. Exhibitionism is king here, obviously. Those off-duty employees who have something to prove, something to show off, have a big load to blow, or are just a bit drunk are known to bring their partners and/or slaves to this place to put on a good show for their fellows. The stage itself is just an elevated platform with a few stairs, and atop it is a large but otherwise simple leather couch surrounded by several king sized mattresses to allow for quite a few 'performances' simultaneously. In front of the stage are a few folding chairs, folding tables, and drink coolers, and during busy nights there will be competitions in which bookies pass by to collect bets.`;
				perimeter = `The grounds leading up to the entrance admitting land vehicles are paved over with an impressively thick layer of cement. This cement layering is fortified with numerous concrete barricades and proximity mines, and although your vehicle units know which routes to use to avoid these traps, an invading opponent will not.`;
				roleplaying = `There is a powerful trend of redefined sexuality in the Firebase, as many of the soldiers enlisted in your service have come out as openly homosexual, bisexual, or pansexual. Futanari transformation options have taken the public psyche by storm as well, as your gay, lesbian, and bi/pan-sexual personnel have taken the plunge and joined the futanari movement. One can see the results of their surgeries proudly on display during the more frequent public nudity and public sex episodes visible throughout the environment as well. Especially notable is the expression and recognition of gender within the Firebase; every free person who has been sufficiently promoted is regarded as being 'Male' and every slave and rookie soldier or staff member is considered as female, regardless of their actual biology. Finally, the remaining demographic of ardently heterosexual men and women find their refuge in the new fashion for sexy futanari slaves. These slaves are prized and shared for their sexual versatility, with their tits, curves, genitalia, and skills, they thankfully have something for everybody. These juicy innovations form the core of your fluid, lurid cultural norm.`;

When she first entered the bedroom, she found the deluxe diamond ring set you bought for her and her future spouse. She also saw the extravagant modular wedding gown you've had made to her exact measurements, for her special day. And to ensure her special day is extra special, you have not forgotten to provide her with a specific premium surgery voucher, to grant her a free virginity restoration procedure at any clinic in the arcology, at any time of her choosing.`;

They also give handjobs on demand to the soldiers while they drink, and sometimes flash soldiers that walk by if business is slow.`;

And in a way, they are. Well-stocked juice bars occupy the hangar's busier corners, while the bathroom's many stalls are kept spotless by a well-staffed janitorial outfit. An inviting but expensive deli-grocery shop and adjacent ATM machine lie near the entrance too, their clean presentation almost beckoning to the staff and pilots of the hangar to enter.`;
				aircraft = `The aircraft themselves have taken on a particular mood too. The individual aircraft are referred to as 'female' so as to acknowledge their beauty and their subservience to the will of their operators. High Resolution colorful pin-up girls adorn the exteriors of every aircraft in use via advanced and interactive motion illustration wallpapers, with every individual aircraft having a bodacious, responsive, and unique mascot character representing it. Therefore, some of the enemy units that find themselves targeting your aircraft at close range are sometimes reluctant to open fire upon them, not desiring to destroy such lovely ladies.`;

Those off-duty employees who are ready to make their love and commitment to their partners official are known to bring their partners and/or slaves to this place to say their vows in the sight of their fellows. The stage itself is just an elevated platform flanked by majestic arches, but atop it is a large pulpit from which the ordained officer guides the soon-to-be newlyweds through the wedding ceremony. In front of the stage are a few polished chairs and ornately clothed tables. During actual wedding nights the larger of the tables are used for holding drinks, foods, and wedding cake, and during such events there will be all manner of jovial wedding games held.`;

As sexual exclusivity and romantic attachment have grown, public nudity and public sex between soldiers have been on the decline. A stronger priority has been placed on couples' privacy as a result. Finally, more and more army wives are finding themselves pregnant, and some have already given birth. The children of Firebase couples are prized and raised by the entire community. Their entire childhood are a diversified, 'slow burn' form of training. By the time they are adolescents, every child will have has an excellent physical, vocational, and military education involving dozens of seasoned mentors.

This flying monolith is very difficult to manufacture, for it is designed to reach embattled trouble zones very quickly despite its massive weight, make rapid landings in impromptu LZs despite its massive bulk, and endure heavy fire and extreme weather to evacuate wounded personnel despite being a lightly armored aircraft. This variant of the OMEGA-series can take in hundreds of casualties for the onboard staff to stabilize, before dropping them off at the Firebase for truly intensive care. Given its prestige, ease of use, and tremendous durability, The Colonel has been known to occasionally use it to personally evacuate endangered friendly platoons in the field or sometimes even desperate refugees, whenever she needs a productive diversion from her usual duties.`;

They even come with roof hardpoint mounts for mounting light remote-operated weapons. Thanks to their stellar support systems they also ensure driver safety and orientation during use, reliably absorbing and redistributing the energy received from the multitude of shocks, bounces, g-forces, jolts, jumps, and other maneuverability hiccups that would make these vehicles impossible to handle without them. All that being said, they are very fun to drive and eventually master.

				foods = `Delightful platters of bewildering varieties of foods and baked treats are available on demand, as the cooks and slave-cooks toil day and night on rotation to keep it all coming. Each soldier gets a tray at every meal to fill and stack as he or she pleases, with a small free packet of recreational drugs given with every meal.`;
				media = `Quotes, stories, and essays from across the ages written on the topics of desire, indulgence, pleasure, or the importance of these things to the human experience are all available in lots of little booklets available by the stack throughout the Firebase. Meanwhile, pornography featuring curvy, plush, or even obese women is easily accessible on the laminated tablets that have been distributed throughout the Firebase.`;
				slaves = `Many of the slaves here are quite hardworking; they need to supply a constant amount of food, drink, drugs, games, media, clean holes, and other entertainments to the impatient soldiers around, who are in constant need of fast gratification. The slaves deal with all the stress and anxiety by indulging in some extra drinks and drugs themselves, and they have some extra soft padding on their bodies and assets to prove it.`;

This open air resort is a widely frequented attraction; with support staff, soldiers, and even some highly-favored slaves partaking of its attractions whenever they have the time. The air is heavy with drug fumes and the smell of food. You see a few empty alcohol bottles floating idly in the steamy water.`;
				barracks = `Every bed unit has a tiny refrigerator unit attached at the head. At any given time, a cold drink, some cool leftovers, or a chilled shot of injections is just within arm's reach for any soldier resting. Above soldiers' heads is a small touchscreen monitor attached to an adjustable arm, so that troops are never without options for entertainment either.`;
				armoury = `Cushioned couches, lounge chairs, and futons lie all around the armoury, and on every last one of them lies a debriefed soldier sleeping off their last deployment with the help of some opium. Most of them haven't even bothered to change out of their fatigues, and many have their weapons and body armor strewn carelessly on the floor beside them. Further still, a few have their pants pulled down to their ankles, whilst an intoxicated slave-whore lazily rides them. Heavy smoke fills the air, and adjacent to the central quartermaster's booth is a tidy fast food bar where shots of soft drinks, small plates of fried foods, and tiny condiments are always in quick supply for those that the time to spare.`;
				commandCenter = `There are drug platters, snack bowls, and punch bowls for every battle station of the command center. During combat maneuvers the staff here are especially ravenous, chugging down large amounts of substance while they send messages that carry power over life and death. The pressure to succeed and secure victory is high, and in order to cope, the staff consume.`;
				drugLab = `The distribution point of the drug laboratory is an eerie place, with a very thick white mist for soldiers to stroll through on their way to the drug selection buffet. The mist is so dense and rich that many soldiers report feeling either high or buzzed after just a few minutes inside of it.`;
				personalItems = `Naturally, your military employees living here have learned to make life easier for themselves; when off-duty, and even sometimes on-duty, you can see any of them wearing light & airy clothing, snack pouches strapped to their wrists, memory foam pillow-coats for casual snoozing whenever idle, drug-filled auto-injection needle pistons strapped to their arms, cozy haptic-operated mechanized wheelchairs equipped with built-in tablets & speakers & coolers, or some other leisure-related paraphernalia.`;
				droneBay = `Your drone technicians are proud of how little upkeep the drones they work on require, how little time they need to spend on tune-ups whenever maintenance time does finally come around, and how easy said maintenance is. Your drones haven't been upgraded too often, as their sheer power output is high enough to be sufficient for operational requirements for a long time to come.`;
				garage = `There are treats of all kinds all over the garage, to set the hardworking staff here at ease. Unclad sex slaves bounce up and down on the laps of debriefed crewmen while waitress slaves rush about carrying platters of hors d'oeuvres to mechanics that summon them, feeding the mechanics hand-to-mouth while they make their adjustments. There are drugs all over the garage too, half-snorted, half-injected, and half smoked. Substances pepper the garage as the workmen get their fixes in between the fixes they perform on the vehicles. It is not uncommon to find tweakers passed out underneath or next to the vehicles they were just tweaking because of this.`;
				vehicle = `The staff of the garage work hard within a very comfortable environment, and according to them they need their many comforts, but your combat-active crewmen deserve some comforts as well. On the interior of every vehicle are very plush massage-chair seats, powerful air conditioning suites, and of course, delightful compact pill dispensers that help ensure that no deployment is ever a dull one.`;
				hangar = `The personnel within the hangar work with great levity, with every person's working shift beginning with a tall glass of beer (barring a direct attack on the arcology). Your staff and pilots are aware that their combat role is not as physically strenuous as that of their mechanized and infantry comrades, and they fully intend on taking advantage of that fact to get more partying done. All around the hangar, right next to well-serviced aircraft, you can see idle personnel doing lines on the nearest available surface, dancing together in empty spaces, enjoying succulent desert foods and expensive drinks on large trays, and so on. Your pilots are very relaxed too, with their drug-induced states being a useful asset in their high-risk flight missions that sometimes require them to make very brave maneuvers in order to more effectively engage enemy forces. As such, your ace pilots are some of the most high-tolerance users you've ever seen.`;
				aircraft = `The personnel of the hangar are impressively pampered on their own, but they seem to have applied their dedication to delight to the vehicles in their care as well. Every airframe has been carefully enlarged to fit ever more luxuries and comforts into every aircraft. Internal heating and cooling systems are enhanced, every passenger compartment comes with its own wallscreen HDTV, and soft padded reclining seats line each passenger compartment, among other accommodations. No effort is spared in ensuring deployed troops and pilots are put at ease as soon as they mount up. After all, isn't continuous gratification a key aspect of Hedonism?`;
				luxuries = `A stark narrow building occupies the space near the drug laboratory, where it can receive easy shipments of anesthetics, filtrates, and detoxifying substances from the lab for the sake of any visitor in need of them. Within this spacious zone lies a long row of surgical chairs, where occupants can simply sit down and be placed into a deep rest by the numerous attendants, before being operated upon by the autosurgery suites above to receive advanced liposuction, carcinogenic filtration, and curative injection procedures that quickly and somewhat painlessly prolong their lives and repair the damage to their bodies incurred by their wild and carefree lifestyles within the Firebase. For those willing to pay the fees, this place provides the pleasure-obsessed population with powerful longevity solutions that they cannot replicate elsewhere within the Firebase, and eliminating the need to settle for intermittent diet & exercise or to waste their free time traveling to the crowded clinics in the arcology above. Your warriors and their support staff are all grateful for the opportunity to sustain their truly decadent lifestyles without guilt or consequence.`;

A small artificial lake has been built outside the Firebase entrance to host a small but well furnished premium yacht. The yacht lazily makes its daily revolutions around this lake, filled with rare and ever-changing entertainments that one cannot find inside the Firebase itself.`;
				roleplaying = `Your soldiers are rather lackadaisical about themselves and their bodies; the Firebase is a carefree place. Fun and relaxation are pursuits of choice, as the weekly orgies, eating competitions, and drug exhibitions require little effort to enjoy. The peer pressure to indulge and make the most of each day is inescapable, and every individual has been seen participating in most of the delights available at least once. Obviously, every person down here, bar some of the newer recruits, has a very jolly disposition. Some are drunk, high, or both. Others are passed out. Some are just laughing at the others. However, everyone is thoroughly entertained.`;

Every weekend she has entire trays of food and substances brought to her pavilion on rotation, and you have no idea where she manages to put it all. She's certainly indulging her desires a lot more.

This is The Colonel's cult now, and from here she is free to cultivate her very own band of devotees. You do not know if she grew up regularly attending a religious setting like this, but you do note that she did appreciate having such a sycophantic retreat away from the sex, violence, and noise of the Firebase underground. Even she needs a few quiet meditative days sometimes.`;
				foods = `The food supplies packages the Firebase receives daily now come with consecrated 'purity seals', assuring the cooks as to the food's freshness and holiness. The food itself hasn't changed much, but each meal now comes with a small side dish featuring plain white bread slices and a shot of red wine, so as to signify a sacrifice or meditation of some kind.`;

They show every bit of each service, from opening hymns and prayers to final announcements, and always in precise high definition film (especially during the ceremonial orgies).`;

The (wo)men of the cloth speak of loyalty, faith, rewards to come, the righteousness of You and your 'Crusaders'.`;
				cages = `Everyday, the captives kept in the processing cages must learn a new hymn or a new chapter from the Holy Book, word for word. Backsliders who do not learn the assigned content by end of day are made to repent of their faithlessness, through whipping and the gnashing of teeth.`;
				commonArea = `Every chair is engraved with a powerful verse of scripture from your Holy Book, and a large ornate den has been constructed on the eastern fringe of the common area to serve as the Firebase's orthodox confession booths. War is hell, and here, soldiers are often invited to speak anonymously with the compassionate and nonjudgmental priests of the faith to share their most troublesome memories. It is only here that they can safely unload their emotional burdens of guilt, anxiety, and fear to the benevolent unseen listener, and receive absolution.`;

Disguised speakers tucked away in corners play gentle, unobtrusive hymns that ease the troops to sleep at nights, and the beds themselves are painted in majestic colors that herald the glorious destinies of the faithful that use them.`;
				armoury = `At the entrance of the armoury, a pair of priests stand ready to greet every single entrant with an oil anointment and quickly chanted Prayer of Protection. For those that finish their battle preparations quickly and seek additional enchantment, horizontal stone slabs are to be found along a wall near the exit, where one can lie down and receive a laying of hands upon themselves by chattel habit-clad slavegirls with well oiled hands and a hymn of their lips. In one corner, a few squads of fully-kitted soldiers huddle around a fiery chaplain, as his sermon riles them up for their righteous task ahead!`;
				commandCenter = `A massive chandelier dominates the ceiling of the command center, shining a golden shining light over the entire command space. A pair of chaplains stand vigil at the entrance, granting anointments and quick ritual blessings upon staff members that come onto their shift, and each command shift starts with the relevant staff gathering together to say ritual prayers for sound judgement, swift decision-making, and furious conquest in your name.`;
				drugLab = `Storage rooms within the drug laboratory have a unique addition; a well-kept shrine is to be found in each one. Each shrine serves as an anointed packaging center, staffed by clergy who are busy in prayer and packing, simultaneously both safeguarding and enchanting the drugs they organize and store behind them, with the help of the mystical spiritual energy that only they can provide.`;
				personalItems = `Pleasing is the sight of the Firebase's humble supplicants making use of the trinkets purchased in the name of the faith. Of course, your Holy Book is a best seller around here, but so are supplementary items like hymn books, tapers, wood or metal carved holy symbols or prayer beads, blessed oils, and robes, head coverings, & habits for every rank of believer. Of course premium services like burial ceremonies or the granting of indulgences are popular selections too, for those who feel sufficient conviction to need them and have the money to afford them.`;
				droneBay = `Every inch of your reconnaissance drones has been carefully repainted to make them directly resemble ghastly flying skulls. As they hover above the battlefield, those few enemies that spot them and futile try to shoot them down are deftly reminded by their appearance that death is nigh, and that the final demise is coming soon.`;
				garage = `Some would say that the Firebase's garage is ruled by superstition. Of course, the garage staff disagrees with this notion; in the garage, there is only Rite and Rote. The colorfully robed technological priests of the garage facility always take care to perform all necessary rituals before, during, and after each repair, inspection, and augmentation of each vehicle. Chants and incantations of all measures are properly recited during routine maintenance jobs so as to properly honor every vehicle's presence, and properly blessed vehicles that crewmen should place their faith in are properly marked with sacred seals, with veteran and distinguished crews having privileged access to these exalted vessels. Overall, repairs take a bit longer to perform due to the extra ritualism, but since these ministrations provide divine protection, as well as further distinction from the heathens who do not pray as such, is that really a loss?`;
				vehicle = `Every vehicle unit comes with several holy book and hymn book copies in a special fireproof underneath the driver's seat; it is hoped that these extra copies might be used in the field to help spread the faith to heathen lands that your vehicle units visit. Handwritten prayers have been scrawled onto the interior surfaces of many vehicles of well, to attract good fortunes, and blessed wax candles are sometimes brought along by the crewmen and burnt before combat for this purpose as well.`;
				hangar = `Your original hangar staff have submitted themselves completely to faith and become a sacred order of robed technological priests. This ministry of flight takes its calling very seriously; its members have even replaced their organic arms with modular bionic arms that can attach and detach all manner of intricate power tools at will. Every act of repair and improvement is consecrated by an episode of prayer and ritual; scented oils lubricant your flying machines while holy mechanical instruments assemble and dissemble airframe components according to the sanctified maintenance guidelines. With this level of devotion and care, any instance of malfunction or failure from your aircraft during future operations can be considered nothing short of a bad omen.`;
				aircraft = `Not willing to risk desecrating the numerous litanies of the faith by exposing them to enemy fire on the outside of your craft, your selected personal favorite songs of prayer and excerpts of scripture are instead diligently inscribed onto every inch the interior of the aircraft's cockpits and passenger sections, where vehicle occupants can see them and have their resolve and conviction bolstered by them before and after battle. The ceilings of each aircraft's interior must be scrubbed clean of soot every week as well, since thick and tall handmade wax candles are burnt inside of the aircraft interiors during all hours of aircraft operation so as to appease the spirit and grant divine protections.`;
				luxuries = `A grand chapel now occupies the prime area behind the common area. The peculiar architecture of the structure, combined with the highly specific paint scheme and meticulous interior decoration, makes the building itself demand a certain respect from all who enter. The layout of the building is complex, with sections for laying and using prayer mats, rows of pews for adherents to sit and be ministered to, and platforms for clergy and choir to take their place upon during services. It is also a place of great beauty; unique paintings and huge stained glass mosaic windows adorn the walls and ceilings as they illustrate the faith in ways that mere words would fail to do. On holy days, hymnal music and calls to prayer can be heard from within the building, inviting all to come and partake of the fellowship, prayer, and release within. There is no doubt that this holy temple serves as the centerpiece to the Firebase's spiritual culture.`;

Your exciting new religion fills a void within your warriors that killing, drugging, and whoring do not. For many it provides comfort, and for those who do not ask too many questions, it provides answers. Rather than face cremation, the bodies of your fallen are ritually buried, ensuring optimal passage into the next life. Weekly ceremonies are held for community meditation on matters of the spirit, and the tenets of your faith are taught consistently throughout basic training alongside the conventional curricula. Soldiers and staff can be heard humming hymns or quietly chanting sacraments as they clean weapons and tools, get dressed, move about, and perform many other typical tasks, including fucking. Quite a few officers and NCO's double as priests too, and army chaplains are a coveted addition to any platoon that doesn't already have one. It is common for deployed troops to pray for protection for themselves and their comrades before mounting up and heading for battle, and as you see a fully kitted infantry section huddled in a prayer circle right now, you are confident that the new faith has succeeded.`;

				droneBay = `Every inch of your reconnaissance drones has been carefully repainted to make them directly resemble a globe-shaped representation of the planet Earth. As they hover above the battlefield, those few enemies that spot them and futile try to shoot them down are deftly reminded by their appearance that the earth abides, and that the world will go on just fine without them.`;
				garage = `Some would say that the Firebase's garage has become a mere showroom. Of course, the garage staff disagrees with this notion; the garage has become a place of demonstration and opportunity. The entire garage has been carefully rearranged; the repair, maintenance, and upgrade bays have been tightly reconfigured to fit snugly into the rear sections of the facility; the forefront of the floorspace has been repurposed to showcase the Firebase's newest and most exciting ground warfare vehicle platforms and upgrades to merchants, commanders, representatives, and dignitaries from a variety of allied and neutral territories and arcologies, as a basis for prospective future cooperation and trade deals, and of course, a form of threat deterrence against those secretly plotting hostilities. Exotic foods and wines are kept on store and made available during exhibition events so as to properly honor each VIP's prescience, and sometimes properly distinguished garage staff and vehicle crews are made to dress up and be introduced to these powerful figures as exalted VIP's in their own right. Overall, repairs take a bit longer to perform due to the troublesome reduction in operating space the workers have, but since these trade shows provide unique support and permissions from abroad, as well as further distinction from the multitude of less cooperative arcologies who do not form international ties as such, is that really a loss?`;
				vehicle = `Every vehicle unit comes with several empty and half-empty scrapbooks, lots of gel pens, and several modern Polaroid & HD cameras with extra film and hard disks in reserve, all packed within a special fireproof box underneath the driver's seat; it is hoped that these materials might be used in the field to help vehicle crews capture and better documents the experiences, sights, and discoveries of your vehicle units as they explore, learn, and fight through foreign lands.`;
				hangar = `Your original hangar staff have socialized themselves completely to the multiculturalist agenda, and have become a well-connected group within the Free Cities' international aviation engineering community. This flight club takes its profession very seriously; its members have even invested in modular bionic exosuits that can attach and detach all manner of intricate power tools at will. Every act of repair and improvement is cross-checked and verified by several qualified personnel before the serviced aircraft is approved for its net flight. Scented candles from abroad alleviate the stench of the heavy oils that lubricate your flying machines, while trendy global-trotting music drowns out the sound of heavy mechanical instruments at work. With this level of oversight and professionalism, any instance of malfunction or failure from your aircraft during future operations can be considered nothing short of sheer coincidence.`;
				aircraft = `Unbeknownst to the variety of non-hostile actors that your aircraft must pass overhead in order to reach their next mission, your selected personal favorite quotes, books & articles excerpts, and works of art taken from your multiculturalist collection are diligently inscribed onto every inch the interior of the aircraft's cockpits and passenger sections, where vehicle occupants can see them and have their resolve and conviction bolstered by them before and after battle. The ceilings of each aircraft's interior must be scrubbed clean of soot every week as well, since thick and tall imported wax candles are burnt inside of the aircraft interiors during all hours of aircraft operation in remembrance of every pilot and passenger that has died while operating from that aircraft.`;
				luxuries = `A grand supermarket now occupies the prime area behind the common area. The familiar architecture of the structure, combined with the highly prolific paint scheme and globalized interior decoration, makes the building itself achieve a certain rapport with all who enter. The layout of the building is complex, with sections for buying international delicacy foods, rows of racks for shoppers to buy rare and specialized tools and trinkets, and platforms for customers to browse all manner of Free Cities and Old World apparels, luxury cars, exotic pets, and many other amusements. It is also a place of great finds; highly coveted niche publications and artworks are on offer in the less frequented corners, and huge high resolution wallscreens adorn the walls and ceilings as they illustrate the newest products and clearance sales on offer. Everyday, upbeat music and audio adverts can be heard from within the building, inviting all to come and partake of the fun within. There is no doubt that this place serves as the centerpiece to the Firebase's materialistic culture.`;
				perimeter = `A carefully paved world-class swimming pool occupies the exterior of the Firebase, with an integrated water heater, several water slides, and even a built-in waterfall. The pool and its surrounding platform plays host to the regular pool parties and swimming competitions that are open to all soldiers and staff that have some free time. Laughter can frequently be heard from the swimwear-clad partygoers as they hang out and socialize here.`;
				roleplaying = `Lengthy, good-spirited debates and competitions have become regular activities in the Firebase, and that is to be expected. Your exciting, inclusive tolerant, and artistic multiculture fills a void within your warriors that killing, drugging, and whoring do not. For many it provides new outlooks on life, for those that delve deep enough, it provides novel reams of worldly wisdom. Rather than take up space in cemeteries, the bodies of your fallen are promptly cremated to make more room for the living. Every week, ceremonies are held in honor of Life itself. Sanctioned protocols for properly interacting with non-hostile civilians, soldiers, and slaves from foreign countries and arcologies are taught consistently throughout basic training alongside the conventional curricula, which has so far worked well in avoiding faux pas that could have lead to needless conflict with members of other cultures. Soldiers and staff can be heard humming internationally-popular songs or quietly chanting military cadences as they clean weapons and tools, get dressed, move about, and perform many other typical tasks, including fucking. Quite a few officers and NCO's double as language teachers too, and trained interpreters are a coveted addition to any platoon that doesn't already have one. It is common for deployed troops to exchange gifts with one another before mounting up and heading for battle, and as you see a fully kitted infantry section huddled around an ornate tree right now, you are confident that the globalization effort has succeeded.`;

Sometimes when she is relaxing or sleeping she'll wear just a simple comfortable bra and panties, like most women around the world do by now too. Her pavilion contains a wide assortment of goods made from countries all over the world, not just this part of it.

Before the vanguard's morale can break however, The Colonel shows up in person behind her own lines, kitted in a customized power armor and dragging, of all things, a hydraulic trebuchet loaded with a crudely-welded large metal box. She launches the box from beyond your Mercenaries' line of sight, sending it reeling towards them and predicting that they will try to shoot it out of the sky.

However, the bomblets do succeed in detonating the various ammo dumps that were feeding your Mercenaries' blazing guns. The chain explosions, resulting fires, destroyed cover, and widespread casualties and confusion all create the perfect opportunity for The Colonel to storm the previously implacable barricade at the head of her troops, with her followers rushing the merc lines and blasting off the heavy armor plating of your disoriented Mercenaries themselves before stabbing them to death, or in some cases, hauling off the dis-armored and defeated female Mercenaries they discover for immediate use.`);

On your order, your most loyal subordinates, the ones who were with you since the early days to patrol your arcology before you even had drones to protect it, fight their way to through the carnage of your panicking civilians on The Promenade to get to the exact hidden elevators that your Personal Assistant specifies for them. Their destination is the arcology's reactor complex, of course. Following the PA's instructions precisely, they arm their many high-yield explosive charges on your now-exposed and de-stabilized reactor, and in one final service to you, detonate them, creating a colossal explosion. The rapidly ascending heretics quite literally have the rug pulled from under them, as the blast takes out nearly all of the arcology's lesser foundational support beams, thus collapsing many thousands of metric tons of concrete, steel, plastic, and plaster out from underneath the upward bound Colonel and her men... And everyone else, unfortunately. With no foundation any longer, all of your arcology's interior Sectors are utterly gutted from the bottom-up by gravity itself, and everything beneath your ration-stocked, backup-powered Penthouse crumbles to the earth.

Of course, no one will ever know that you sacrificed the arcology deliberately in order to save yourself; it is all too easy to claim that The Colonel carelessly damaged the reactor complex during her assault, ironically causing her own defeat.
