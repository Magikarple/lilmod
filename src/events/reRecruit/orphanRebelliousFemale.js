Run by a well-meaning non-profit organization active in numerous of the Free Cities, the facility does house quite a few orphans (both local and saved from the chaos of the old world), doing excellent work in teaching them and finding new homes. Still, with times being what they are, the people running things do have a... realistic outlook, in the end. And so, in order to keep the orphanage going, those living there who aren't adopted till they reach maturity are sold as slaves. Legally this practice is easily arranged, as the life-debt for any of the orphans builds up over the years, pretty much automatically putting them over the limit for enslavement.`);
