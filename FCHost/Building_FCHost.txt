BUILD REQUIREMENTS

The below requirements must be met to build this project.

 - Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) 112.0.1 or newer.  The windows build is
   currently configured to operate with the X64 binary distribution of CEF.

 - CMake version 2.8.12.1 or newer.

 - Linux/MacOS requirements:
   I haven't tested these platforms, and there is platform-specific code missing.
   Shouldn't be too hard to add, check the CEF distribution and treat FCHost
   as a derivative of tests/cefsimple.
   
 - Have the environment variable CEF_ROOT set to the root of your CEF distribution.
 - Have the CMake binary folder added to your path e.g. for Windows C:\Program Files\CMake\bin.

 - Windows requirements:
   Visual Studio 2019 (the community edition will work fine) or newer with the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed.

BUILD STEPS

If you are running Windows and meet the above requirements then within the root of FCHost/, 
execute cmake_vs2019.bat which will generate FCHost.sln in the same location.
Now open FCHost.sln in Visual Studio 2019 
and build from there via tool bar -> Build -> Build Solution or Ctrl + Shift + B.
If using Visual Studio 2022, simply use cmake_vs2022.bat instead.

The resulting binary and supporting files will be in
FCHost/fchost/Debug, or FCHost/fchost/Release depending on the configuration
selected in Visual Studio via the drop down found under the Build and Debug tool bar headers.  

You should be able to zip up the contents of the 
Release folder and distribute them to another machine or user if desired.
Due to space and privacy concerns it is suggested that you remove *.html and fchost.ilk prior to distribution. 

If you are not running Windows or you need something else special, please
familiarize yourself with CMake and see the detailed information in CMakeLists.txt.
