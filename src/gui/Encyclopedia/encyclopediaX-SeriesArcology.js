The first arcology was designed in early 2016 by the Berlin-based architecture firm Franz-Crekcht as a "Skyscraper for the next generation" - the A-Series. The original A-Series was made to exist as an arcology integrated within old world nations, but capable of producing its own energy, food, and housing for the population contained within, marketed as buildings you could "Live, work, eat and shop at without ever having to leave".`);
	r.push(`These first arcology units were rolled out by the end of the year based on a standard design prototype, and cheap housing prices combined with the promise of stable white-collar work immediately attracted a sizeable population to the A-series arcologies. Based off of these designs, F-C continued to produce arcology schematics, including the K-series and B-series, and formulated plans for arcologies that could operate in rural, maritime, and even oceanic environments. When the popularity of the Arcology model became evident, other design firms replicated their own takes, producing designs like the V-series, D-series, F-series, and finally the ultra-modern X-series that you presently inhabit, designed more as a quasi-independent city-state than the original "next-generation skyscrapers".`);

As the world outside the increasingly self-sufficient arcologies began to deteriorate, it wasn't long after that before the first arcologies declared independence from their parent nations, creating the original Free Cities we know today.");
