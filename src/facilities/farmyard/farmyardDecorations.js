			"Aztec Revivalist": `It features a large, open ranch, with shallow canals snaking throughout to provide constant fresh water for the livestock in the pens. Large stone sacrificial altars are featured prominently in the middle, and large stone murals depicting warfare between Huitzilopochtli and the forces of darkness line the entire perimeter of the space.`,
			"Egyptian Revivalist": `It does its best to capture the wide open nature of ancient Egyptian farms, including mimicking the irrigation systems fed by the Nile. The stone walls are decorated with murals detailing its construction and your prowess in general, ${V.seeBestiality ? `with animal-bloated slaves featured prominently.` : `hieroglyphs spelling out volumes of praise.`}`,
			"Edo Revivalist": `It does its best to mimic the rice patties and thatch roofed buildings of the Edo period despite the wide variety of crops tended by various slaves. Not every crop can thrive in flooded fields, but the ones that can take advantage of your attention to detail.`,
			"Arabian Revivalist": `Large plots of olive trees and date palms line the outer edges of the main crop area, while a combination of wheat, flax, and barley occupies the interior space. Irrigation canals snake through the area, ensuring every inch of cropland is well-watered.`,
			"Chinese Revivalist": `It does its best to capture the terraces that covered the ancient Chinese hills and mountains, turning every floor into ribbons of fields following a slight incline.

			"Body Purist": `Organic crops and animals are the main feature here, and the animal manure is used as a natural fertilizer for the different plants.`,
			"Slimness Enthusiast": `It features trim animals and slaves alike, not a pound of excess among them. The feed for both livestock and crops are carefully maintained to ensure optimal growth without waste, letting them flourish without being weighed down.`,
