			"Neo-Imperialist": `is white and sterile, filled with so many high-tech machines that you cannot discern the purpose of them all. The space reminds you of a laboratory, kept painstakingly clean at all time by small robotic drones.`,
			"Aztec Revivalist": `is open and airy; a light hint of herbs and natural oil permeates the air. Everything is incredibly sterile, especially the blood management equipment.`,
			"Egyptian Revivalist": `is open and airy; clean rushes are strewn across the floor, making a gentle susurration when anyone crosses the space.`,
			"Edo Revivalist": `is clean and spartan to the point of featurelessness. Spotless tatami mats cover the floor, and partitions divide the space into cubicles.`,
			"Arabian Revivalist": `is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning incense.`,
			"Chinese Revivalist": `is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning medicinal herbs.`,
			"Antebellum Revivalist": `is designed after a sanatorium; enormous windows here ensure there's a constant flow of air and bright sunshine, and the ceiling is particularly high here. Everything is simple and clean.`,
			"Chattel Religionist": `is open and airy; shaded beams of sunlight shine through skylights to bathe each bed in a pool of healing warmth.`,
			"Degradationist": `is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The beds have prominent restraint attachment points to force patients into any position desired.`,
			"Repopulationist": `is warm and inviting, with wide corridors and ample seating for its pregnant clientÃ¨le. All the equipment is designed to accommodate heavily pregnant women.`,
			"Eugenics": `is warm and inviting on one side, cold and utilitarian on the other. Only the toys of the elite are allowed the best of care.`,
			"Asset Expansionist": `is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available ${V.showInches === 2 ? `inch` : `centimeter`} of space is used for equipment specialized to support growth.`,
			"Transformation Fetishist": `is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available ${V.showInches === 2 ? `inch` : `centimeter`} of space is used for equipment specialized to support radical surgery.`,
			"Gender Radicalist": `is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to present slaves coming out of anesthesia with an impression of girlishness.`,
			"Gender Fundamentalist": `is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to keep slaves here for their female health nice and comfortable.`,
			"Physical Idealist": `is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available ${V.showInches === 2 ? `inch` : `centimeter`} of space is used for some piece of equipment useful in making the human body faster or stronger.`,
			"Supremacist": `is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The only hint of its radical uses are the pseudoscientific racialist charts on the walls.`,
			"Subjugationist": `is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The only hint of its radical uses are the pseudoscientific racialist charts on the walls.`,
			"Paternalist": `is warm and inviting, with curved walls and warm colors designed to put patients at their ease. Each bed is well provided with entertainment options.`,
			"Pastoralist": `is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available ${V.showInches === 2 ? `inch` : `centimeter`} of space is used for equipment specialized for human veterinary medicine.`,
			"Maturity Preferentialist": `is comfortable and soothing, with curved walls and cool colors designed to keep patients relaxed. Each bed is provided with refined yet invariably pornographic entertainment options.`,
			"Youth Preferentialist": `is bright and cheerful, with curved walls and pastel colors designed to keep patients in good spirits. Each bed is provided with light entertainment options.`,
			"Body Purist": `is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available ${V.showInches === 2 ? `inch` : `centimeter`} of space is filled with equipment designed to make medicine as low-impact as possible.`,
			"Slimness Enthusiast": `is warm and inviting, with curved walls and warm colors designed to put patients at their ease. Each bed is well provided with entertainment options.`,
			"Hedonistic": `is warm and comfortable, with extra wide, soft, heated beds and ample morphine. Pleasant smells are pumped into the recovery wards, plenty of entertainment is available and chubby nurse in a too small dress with a big bowl of slave food is only a button press away. It can be quite difficult to convince patients to leave.`,
			"Intellectual Dependency": `is bright and cheerful, with plenty of simple amusements to keep bimbos distracted and in bed. A complex locking mechanism promises no chance of a slave wandering off to slake their lust.`,
			"Slave Professionalism": `is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. Any delays in recovery are nothing more than time spent not honing one's talents.`,
			"Petite Admiration": `is open and airy due to all the extra space freed up by shortening the beds. A footrest is the only accommodation made for tall slaves.`,
			"Statuesque Glorification": `is warm and comfortable, if a little cramped; tall slaves require long beds, after all. A meager footstool is the only accommodation made for short slaves.`,
			"standard": `is a well-equipped modern medical facility. Each patient has their own area, with heavy automation to provide them treatment without any human intervention at all.`,
