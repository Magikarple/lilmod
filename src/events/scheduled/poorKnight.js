Your Barons, on the other hand, murmur that he is a rabblerouser, a peasant who has clearly forgotten his station at the bottom of the pyramid, and that to do anything but punish him for his insolence will surely lead to riots and unrest. Such a man would surely be a proud and capable Imperial Knight, but to Knight him would undoubtedly be seen as condoning liberal freedoms in your lower classes, and a Knight drawn from the filthy, unwashed peasants is totally unheard of.`]);
