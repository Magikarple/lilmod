 Keep in mind the slave must have arms and legs.

 78
* core pregnancy system swapped
* fixed some bugs
 Run backwards compatibility. No exceptions.
 I think everything is in place that needs to be in place. Very little beyond behind the scenes type code. If everything went right, there should be nothing really noticeable yet.
 The most obvious change will be the alterations to menopause. It is no longer hard set at 47, instead it drifts slightly year by year. This means that over a slave's lifetime, you will see a variance of when they go through menopause.

2017-08-27

 77

 I don't know.
 Also if your rules are broken, run either backwards compatibility or the rules resetter under options. Both should fix it.

 71
* rest of the vanilla RA changes
 It honestly looks like it didn't break anything. Do run backwards compatibility though.

 70
* vanilla stuff
 Mostly intense growth drugs. Due to our RA changes, I couldn't hook them into it so it will remove them for now. Still have to handle the massive RA changes, which will likely break everything.

 HG will fatten up her slave if hedonistic decadence is in play and will make use of hyper drugs if you have them researched. Also cumsluts will now expand their slave's balls to get more cum.

 24
* fixed a critical bug with the menopause reversal
 It helps to actually link player age with it at game start, you know?

 Smart piercing improvements
 Removed the default smart piercing function, which was nonfunctional for almost all settings of the current implementation of the rules assistant.

 The all sex smart piercing setting no longer automatically targets XY and XX attraction in addition to libido, as these can be done individually.
 Gave smart piercings new settings to suppress XY and XX attraction, which will have minor secondary libido suppressing effects.
 Heavily buffed smart piercing efficiency when improving XY and XX attraction and added minor secondary libido enhancing effects to these settings.

 7

 0.8.8.2

Lolimod (may have some pregmod and optionsmod stuff mixed with it)

New Lolimod - not incorporated

2016-10-06
 0.8.7.1

2016-10-03
 0.8.6.7
 In this update, loli nicknames are back, retirement age can be set lower in policies, and you can now pursue up to 6 FS directions!

2016-09-21

2016-08-19
 0.8.1.4

2016-08-16
 0.8.1.3
 - The "disable age penalties for jobs" submod now has a mechanical effect rather than just changing messages.
 - The long-standing change that allows slaves without balls but with artificial male hormone injections to experience erections has been added in some places where it was missing. In the process a vanilla bug in "SA serve your other slaves" where the wrong slave's attributes were being checked was corrected.
 - Fixed the "flaws her mouth" silliness that somehow snuck back in from the base game. (It should be "quirks her mouth" so it was probably the victim of Replace All.)
 - Incorporates a fix posted on halfchan for the "force her to rape herself" option for new slaves not appearing.
 - Fixed one place in the game where a slave could refer to young slave as a "teenager" although she might be preteen.

 0.8.1.3.1
* Fix for a variable name in "ask her about her feelings."

2016-08-09
